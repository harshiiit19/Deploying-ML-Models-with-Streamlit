# 🚀 Deploying ML Models with Streamlit
This project demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model using Streamlit, making it accessible via a simple and interactive web application.

We trained a Random Forest Regressor on a large car dataset to predict the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) based on features like engine size, horsepower, mileage, and more. The app allows users to input custom car specs and instantly get a price estimate with an intuitive user interface.

🔍 Key Features
     • ✅ Interactive UI for entering car specifications

    • 🧠 Real-time predictions using a trained ML model

    • 📊 Clean visual layout using Streamlit

    • 💾 Model serialized with joblib

    • ☁️ Ready for deployment on Streamlit Cloud
